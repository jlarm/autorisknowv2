        "post_content": "\u003Cp\u003ECybercriminals have learned that ransoming data to stop sales operations can result in handsome rewards, and they are increasingly turning their attention to auto dealerships. The costly attacks of Findlay Auto Group and CDK Global in early summer are two noteworthy examples.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFindlay reportedly lost millions of dollars a day following the attack, which resulted in class-action lawsuits. CDK reportedly paid $25 million to satisfy its ransomer’s demand; its customers are said to have lost $1 billion in sales as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs attackers get more imaginative and emboldened to succeed in making huge rewards, businesses need increasingly strategic ways to prevent cybercrime by taking the fight to the perpetrators.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs cyber activity towards car dealerships has intensified, cyber compliance and prevention companies are ratcheting their defenses. Technologists like Ridgeback Network Defense, with roots in military cybersecurity, give auto dealers hope the cyber wars won’t breach their threshold.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESuch no-latency technology security makes a network unnavigable by an intruder, providing the conditions to expose and eliminate attackers during connection. It also helps security teams and risk advisors quickly see the presence of exposures and vulnerabilities and reveal network hygiene conditions not observed by other tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAny given network connects to a multitude of devices. Some of these connected or once-connected devices present cyber penetration opportunities.

        "post_content_filtered": "Cybercriminals have learned that ransoming data to stop sales operations can result in handsome rewards, and they are increasingly turning their attention to auto dealerships. The costly attacks of Findlay Auto Group and CDK Global in early summer are two noteworthy examples.\r\n\r\nFindlay reportedly lost millions of dollars a day following the attack, which resulted in class-action lawsuits. CDK reportedly paid $25 million to satisfy its ransomer’s demand; its customers are said to have lost $1 billion in sales as a result.\r\n\r\nAs attackers get more imaginative and emboldened to succeed in making huge rewards, businesses need increasingly strategic ways to prevent cybercrime by taking the fight to the perpetrators.\r\n\r\nAs cyber activity towards car dealerships has intensified, cyber compliance and prevention companies are ratcheting their defenses. Technologists like Ridgeback Network Defense, with roots in military cybersecurity, give auto dealers hope the cyber wars won’t breach their threshold.\r\n\r\nSuch no-latency technology security makes a network unnavigable by an intruder, providing the conditions to expose and eliminate attackers during connection. It also helps security teams and risk advisors quickly see the presence of exposures and vulnerabilities and reveal network hygiene conditions not observed by other tools.\r\n\r\nAny given network connects to a multitude of devices. Some of these connected or once-connected devices present cyber penetration opportunities. A screenshot of these opportunities from your network would knock the breath out of you.\r\n\r\nThe best cyber technology observes and reports in real-time on all connected assets and the identity of these assets – or ones your network thinks it remains connected to but is no longer. They have been removed or turned off. These assets include live address spaces for IT, OT (back-end production systems), and IoT (Internet of Things). It also observes and reports on – and can respond to – any communications between live assets, unused Ports, and IP addresses.\r\n\r\nCybersecurity like this:\r\n- Is secure offense against frustrating and costly cyber attacks\r\n- Is 24/7, real-time visualization of all network systems and monitoring of and fulfilling FTC Safeguards Rule compliance requirements.\r\n- Identifies network risks, pinpoints opportunities to harden security and improve function, and measures ROI compared to other IT and security tools\r\n\r\nUsers can instantly implement permissions and security policies to proactively block breach attempts, ensuring your dealership's sensitive data, operations, and customer information are continuously protected. Additionally, the system helps meet regulatory requirements while safeguarding against external attacks and insider threats without adding complexity to your IT operations.\r\n\r\nGiven the risk and cost of cyber attacks, such network protection is a valuable investment.

        "post_content": "\u003Cp\u003ECRYSTAL LAKE, IL, May 22, 2024 - As cyber crimes against auto dealerships escalate, dealers must recognize the importance of conducting frequent physical security audits to supplement any software-driven compliance tool they may be using. This advice comes from Terry Dortch, a leading dealership compliance expert at Automotive Risk Management Partners, whose knowledge in this field is unparalleled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe need for physical audit scrutiny is how dealership electronic and manual processes ensure the integrity of the Safeguards/CARS Rule designed to protect customer information from theft.

        "post_content_filtered": "CRYSTAL LAKE, IL, May 22, 2024 - As cyber crimes against auto dealerships escalate, dealers must recognize the importance of conducting frequent physical security audits to supplement any software-driven compliance tool they may be using. This advice comes from Terry Dortch, a leading dealership compliance expert at Automotive Risk Management Partners, whose knowledge in this field is unparalleled.\r\n\r\nThe need for physical audit scrutiny is how dealership electronic and manual processes ensure the integrity of the Safeguards/CARS Rule designed to protect customer information from theft. The Federal Trade Commission’s CARS Rule adds truth and transparency to the car buying and leasing process by clarifying that certain deceptive or unfair practices are illegal.\r\n\r\n\"While data and cybersecurity breach prevention are undeniably crucial for dealerships, it's important to note that much of the information that identity thieves seek is not deterred by software security in these systems alone,\" Dortch explained.\r\n\r\nOne typical issue dealerships experience is the occurrence or appearance of disparate impact or discriminatory action, which can lead to run-ins with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). To get around such situations, implementing physical audits should be a priority. Regular audits help nip potential threats and identify complicit behaviors quickly. Dealers who prefer less stringent compliance increase their risk of incurring penalties that can significantly impact a dealership's financial health and reputation.\r\n\r\nPotential opportunities for physical data breaches include personal information on documents in deal jackets that are not secured but stacked on F&I office desks and floors, left near photocopy machines, and written on sales and service paperwork left unattended on sales staff and service advisor desks.

        "post_content": "\u003Cp\u003EHello everyone! My name is Terry Dortch, representing Automotive Risk Management Partners. I spend quite a bit of time traveling across the States, interacting with folks from Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia to Northern Illinois, discussing what's currently piquing their interest. Lately, there's been a buzzword making the rounds - \u003Cstrong\u003ECybersecurity\u003C/strong\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECybersecurity isn't new, but what's got people talking is its incorporation into the \u003Cem\u003ESafeguards Rule\u003C/em\u003E. The Safeguards Rule has been around since 2003 and is part and parcel of the Graham Leach Bliley Act. Its primary purpose has always been to protect customer information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EUnderstanding the Cyber Aspect\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI'd like to dive into the \u003Cem\u003Ecyber\u003C/em\u003E aspect of the Safeguards Rule. An amendment due in June seeks to bring clarity and renewed focus to this aspect. However, we must not overemphasize cybersecurity to the detriment of other vital compliance aspects. Both the cyber and real-world elements should be given their due attention.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&quot;We need to step back a minute and take a look at the overall picture of everything.&quot;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EImportance of Physical Compliance\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe more I talk to dealerships, the more I realize how we're neglecting the physical aspects of the compliance piece. These aren't merely theoretical financial risks, they're real concerns that could significantly impact your revenue streams. Missteps within the sales process, backroom operations, or even your body shop operations pose imminent risks that demand our focus.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAlthough data and cybersecurity breaches are critical, let's not overlook the equally, if not more, consequential physical aspects.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EPay Attention to Auditing\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne typical issue dealerships experience is the occurrence or appearance of disparate impact. This can lead to complications and run-ins with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Case in point; a dealership in Northern Illinois currently faces such predicaments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo circumvent such situations, implementing audits should be a priority. Regular audits allow you to nip potential issues in the bud, reducing the chances of heavy penalties. Remember, compliance is an all-encompassing process that requires meticulous attention and consistency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI want to underline that emphasizing the importance of real-world, tangible compliance does not equate to downplaying the significance of cybersecurity. Both elements play a crucial role in upholding dealership standards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EComprehensive Compliance\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEnsure the entity you're consulting comprehends the complexity and entirety of your compliance landscape. Here's a simple metaphor. If your compliance is a dike with several holes, don't patch one hole while ignoring the rest. Take care of all the holes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple of years back, an automotive group in Illinois faced hefty fines to the tune of $10 million due to negligence in physical compliance. Don't fall into the same trap.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EFinal Thoughts\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENavigating the waters of compliance is a journey. Take adequate time to understand every facet and ensure whoever's guiding you shares the same comprehensive approach. Furthermore, keep the lines of communication open with your vendors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any questions or would like to discuss these aspects further, don't hesitate to get in touch. You can reach out via phone or email as per your convenience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil next time, stay safe, stay compliant!\u003C/p\u003E",

        "post_content_filtered": "Hello everyone! My name is Terry Dortch, representing Automotive Risk Management Partners. I spend quite a bit of time traveling across the States, interacting with folks from Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia to Northern Illinois, discussing what's currently piquing their interest. Lately, there's been a buzzword making the rounds - **Cybersecurity**!\r\n\r\nCybersecurity isn't new, but what's got people talking is its incorporation into the *Safeguards Rule*. The Safeguards Rule has been around since 2003 and is part and parcel of the Graham Leach Bliley Act. Its primary purpose has always been to protect customer information.\r\n\r\n## Understanding the Cyber Aspect\r\n\r\nI'd like to dive into the *cyber* aspect of the Safeguards Rule. An amendment due in June seeks to bring clarity and renewed focus to this aspect. However, we must not overemphasize cybersecurity to the detriment of other vital compliance aspects. Both the cyber and real-world elements should be given their due attention.\r\n\r\n\u003E \"We need to step back a minute and take a look at the overall picture of everything.\"\r\n\r\n### Importance of Physical Compliance\r\n\r\nThe more I talk to dealerships, the more I realize how we're neglecting the physical aspects of the compliance piece. These aren't merely theoretical financial risks, they're real concerns that could significantly impact your revenue streams. Missteps within the sales process, backroom operations, or even your body shop operations pose imminent risks that demand our focus.\r\n\r\n*Although data and cybersecurity breaches are critical, let's not overlook the equally, if not more, consequential physical aspects.*\r\n\r\n#### Pay Attention to Auditing\r\n\r\nOne typical issue dealerships experience is the occurrence or appearance of disparate impact. This can lead to complications and run-ins with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Case in point; a dealership in Northern Illinois currently faces such predicaments.\r\n\r\nTo circumvent such situations, implementing audits should be a priority. Regular audits allow you to nip potential issues in the bud, reducing the chances of heavy penalties. Remember, compliance is an all-encompassing process that requires meticulous attention and consistency.\r\n\r\nI want to underline that emphasizing the importance of real-world, tangible compliance does not equate to downplaying the significance of cybersecurity. Both elements play a crucial role in upholding dealership standards.\r\n\r\n#### Comprehensive Compliance\r\n\r\nEnsure the entity you're consulting comprehends the complexity and entirety of your compliance landscape. Here's a simple metaphor. If your compliance is a dike with several holes, don't patch one hole while ignoring the rest. Take care of all the holes.\r\n\r\nA couple of years back, an automotive group in Illinois faced hefty fines to the tune of $10 million due to negligence in physical compliance. Don't fall into the same trap.\r\n\r\n#### Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nNavigating the waters of compliance is a journey. Take adequate time to understand every facet and ensure whoever's guiding you shares the same comprehensive approach. Furthermore, keep the lines of communication open with your vendors.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss these aspects further, don't hesitate to get in touch. You can reach out via phone or email as per your convenience.\r\n\r\nUntil next time, stay safe, stay compliant!",
